This project is a simple e-commerce application built using React with state management handled by Zustand and styled with Tailwind CSS. The application is currently under development and allows users to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and complete purchases.

## 🚧 Project Status: Work in Progress

## 📋 Overview of the Application Structure
* **Product Listing**: Users can view a list of products available in the store.
* **User Authentication and Account Management**:
  * **Login and Registration**: Users can register, log in, and reset their passwords via Firebase authentication. *(Completed)*
* **Shopping Cart and Order Management**:
  * **Cart Handling**: Users can add, remove, and edit the quantity of items in the cart. *(Completed)*
  * **Order Summary**: Displays a summary of the total cost of items in the cart, including taxes and shipping fees. *(Completed)*
  * **Persistent Cart State**: Cart state is stored in `localStorage` (or Firebase), ensuring that it persists between sessions. *(Completed)*
* **Checkout**: A simple checkout page where users can review their order and complete the purchase.
* **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive for both desktop and mobile views.

## 💻 Key Features
* Add, remove, and modify items in the shopping cart.
* Persistent cart state across sessions.
* Detailed product information and responsive design.
* Order summary with calculated taxes and shipping fees.
* User registration, login, and password reset functionality using Firebase.
* Zustand for lightweight and efficient state management.
* Tailwind CSS for fast and consistent styling.

## 🛠️ Implementation
The project follows a component-based structure, making it easy to extend and maintain. Zustand is used to manage the global state (shopping cart), ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience. Tailwind CSS helps in achieving a minimalist and modern design with a focus on responsiveness.

### Cart and Order Management Features
* **Cart Handling**: Users can add, remove, and update the quantity of products in their cart, providing flexibility in managing their orders.
* **Order Summary**: A detailed summary section displays the subtotal, tax, shipping costs, and final total to give users a transparent view of their order.
* **Persistent Cart State**: Using `localStorage` (or Firebase as an alternative), the cart contents are retained between user sessions, enhancing the shopping experience.

## 🛠️ Languages and Tools Used
* **React (JavaScript)**
* **Zustand** for state management
* **Firebase** for authentication
* **Tailwind CSS** for styling
* **Vite** for fast development build tool
* **Git** for version control
* **GitHub** for repository hosting

## Future Enhancements
* Integrating real payment gateways (Stripe/PayPal)
* Adding product categories and filters
* User authentication and order history
* Backend integration for dynamic product data

This project is an ongoing effort, and feedback is always welcome! Stay tuned for updates as new features are added.
